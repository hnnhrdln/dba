    "Part 0: The Dataset\n",
    "The datataset new_weather.csv contains data describing some meteorological indicators of\n",
    "Seattle (temperature, atmospheric pressure, dew point, ...). The data are coded\n",
    "The data is encoded daily and for each encoding is entered the minimum, maximum and average value of the\n",
    "of the indicator. The dataset also has a field (\"Event\") that shows if on that date there was an atmospheric phenomenon.\n",
    "has been an atmospheric phenomenon.\n",
    "The aim of the exercise is to predict if on a certain date there has been an atmospheric event\n",
    "regardless of its nature.\n",
    "Part 1: Analysis (10 points)\n",
    "1. Load the dataset and name it with a variable called \"dataset\"\n",
    "2. How many instances are contained in the dataset? _______ The dataset is complete (i.e. for every\n",
    "(i.e. for each instance all attribute values are always specified - there are no \"missing values\")?\n",
    "_______ If they exist, indicate what they are and whether the absence of these values affects the possibility of\n",
    "predict what is required (point 1).\n",
    "Is the dataset balanced with respect to the class to be predicted? _________\n",
    "3. Create a new attribute \"Range_Temperatures\" that measures the daily temperature range.\n",
    "Is anything particular observed in the distribution of values? (points 3)\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "_______________________________________________________\n",
    "4. Represent the maximum temperature and minimum temperature in a graph (points 2).\n",
    "5. How many weather events occur in 2015? How are they distributed by types over the months?\n",
    "Represent with the most appropriate graph this distribution (points 2).\n",
    "6. Make a pivot table\n",
    "http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html\n",
    "to show for each year, for each month, and for each type of event the average value of the measured\n",
    "average value of the measured temperature. Show the result in a diagram (points 2).\n",
    "Part 2: Transformation and Prediction (20 points)\n",
    "1. Scikit-learn uses a numpy array to make its predictions. The elements\n",
    "of the numpy array must be of the same numeric data type. It is therefore necessary to\n",
    "transform the dataset to make it usable with scikit. Create a new dataset\n",
    "from the previous one and transform the values of the field \"Events\" into 1 / 0 depending on whether an event is recorded or not.\n",
    "2. You want to predict whether or not there is an event based on the other attributes in the dataset.\n",
    "attributes in the dataset. Split the dataset so that 2/3 of the elements are contained in a new\n",
    "dataset \"train\" and 1/3 in the dataset \"test\" (point 1).\n",
    "Evaluate the accuracy obtained with the BernoulliNB model on both datasets.\n",
    "(from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB)\n",
    "3. The accuracy value obtained is _____________ (points 1).\n",
    "4. What do you find out by analyzing the confusion matrices? (points 2)\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "_______________________________________________________\n",
    "5. If you use a Decision Tree based model what accuracy value do you get? Does it change\n",
    "anything in the confusion matrix? (points 2)\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "_______________________________________________________\n",
    "6. What accuracy value is obtained with a 10 Fold cross validation and the model based on\n",
    "Decision Tree ________________ and the model based on BernoulliNB ________________\n",
    "Is it more reliable the evaluation made with the cross validation or the one made with an arbitrary subdivision\n",
    "of the dataset in two parts, training set and test set? For what reason? (points 2).\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "___________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "______________________________________________________________\n",
    "7. Graphically test and compare some machine learning algorithms chosen from the libraries of\n",
    "scikit libraries (point 2).\n",
    "8. Create a new \"reduced\" dataset with only average values of atmospheric indicators.\n",
    "atmospheric indicators. For each feature, divide the range of values into 6 groups. Replace the original\n",
    "value of the attribute with a number from 1 to 6 indicating the membership in the specific group.\n",
    "group. Evaluate the accuracy obtained with any algorithm used previously\n",
