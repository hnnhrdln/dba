    "Part 0: The Dataset\n",
    "The datataset BankMarketingDataSey.csv (csv format with \";\" separator) contains data of\n",
    "marketing campaigns activated by a Portuguese bank. The purpose of the exercise is to predict whether the\n",
    "customer will subscribe a deposit (variable y). These are the fields of the dataset (extracted from UCI\n",
    "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#)\n",
    "0 - id (numeric)\n",
    "1 - age (numeric)\n",
    "2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue- collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid',\n",
    "'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'services', 'student', 'technician', 'unemployed',\n",
    "unknown)\n",
    "3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced', 'married', 'single', 'unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)\n",
    "means divorced or widowed)\n",
    "4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y', 'basic.6y', 'basic.9y', 'high.school', 'illiterate',\n",

    "5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n",

    "Part 1: Analysis (10 points)\n",
    "1. Load the dataset and name it with a variable called \"dataset\".\n",
    "2. How many instances are contained in the dataset? _______ The dataset is complete (i.e. for every\n",
    "instance all attribute values are always specified - there are no \"missing values\")?\n",
    "_______ (points 1).\n",
    "Is the dataset balanced in terms of the class to be predicted? _________\n",
    "3. Visualize the distribution of ages in a specific plot (points 2)\n",
    "4. Through analysis of the dataset, is it possible to hypothesize whether the attribute \"marital status\" affects\n",
    "in prediction? How does it affect prediction? Justify the answer. (points 3)\n",
    "________________________________________________________________\n",
    "5. Calculate a series that represents for each age the percentage of people who have\n",
    "subscribed to a deposit. Then calculate a series representing for each age the percentage of people who have not\n",
    "of people who have not made a deposit. To represent graphically the two series\n",
    "(also in distinct diagrams and to carry out considerations on the obtained result - if they are born)\n",
    "(points 4).Part 2: Transformation and Prediction (20 points)\n",
    "1. Scikit-learn uses a numpy array to make its predictions. The elements\n",
    "of the numpy array must be of the same numeric data type. It is therefore necessary to\n",
    "transform the dataset to make it usable with scikit.\n",
    "Transform categorical values into numeric values by assigning a specific value to each category\n",
    "of values. In particular, assign the value 0 to the \"no\" value of the \"y\" attribute and 1 to the value\n",
    "\"yes.\n",
    "Eliminate any attributes that for some reason (Specify it) are considered unnecessary for the\n",
    "classification. Eliminate all instances for which there is an attribute that assumes value\n",
    "unknown. (point 3)\n",
    "2. You want to predict the subscription of a repository based on the attributes in the dataset.\n",
    "Divide the dataset so that 3/4 of the elements are contained in a new dataset \"train\" and\n",
    "1/4 in the dataset \"test\" (points 1).\n",
    "Train the train and evaluate the accuracy obtained with the Decision Tree model calculated on both the\n",
    "train dataset and on the test dataset. To carry out some considerations on the obtained results, holding\n",
    "in consideration also the analysis of the confusion matrix. (point 4)\n",
    "3. Use another prediction model and compare the results obtained. (points 2)\n",
    "4. Compare the accuracy obtained in steps 2 and 3 with accuracy obtained with a 10 fold\n",
    "cross validation\n",
    "Is it more reliable the evaluation made with cross validation or the one made with an arbitrary subdivision\n",
    "of the dataset in two parts, training set and test set? For what reason? (points 1).\n",
    "5. Create a new numeric dataset that contains only numeric values of the starting dataset.\n",
    "starting dataset. Evaluate the accuracy of this dataset using the models proposed in steps 2 and 3.\n",
    "models proposed in points 2 and 3. (steps 2).\n",
    "6. Add categorical attributes to the numeric dataset in this way: for each attribute\n",
    "For each categorical attribute construct a number of boolean attributes equal to the possible values of the category. Each\n",
    "attribute represents a category The boolean attribute takes the value 1 for the instances of the original dataset that have the value 1.\n",
    "The boolean attribute takes the value 1 for the instances of the original dataset that have the value of the category that the attribute represents. Evaluate\n",
    "the accuracy that is obtained with this dataset using the models proposed in steps 2 and 3.\n",
